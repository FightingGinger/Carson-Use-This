///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// INSTRUCTIONS: Update the header above with the correct due date,
// first/last name(s) and description for this specific project. You should also update
// the first/last name below in the "System.out.println" statement at the beginning
// of the "main()" method. Failure to do so will result in lost points. DO NOT change
// the name of the class or the autograder will give you 0 points.
//
// COLLABORATION: Students may work alone or with 1 (one) partner. AT NO POINT should you
// ever look at the code of your classmate's project OR show your code to help another
// classmate. If you need help, please ask your instructor, who is MORE THAN HAPPY to assist
// you and point you in the right direction.
//
// CHEATING: Your projects will be automatically and algorithmically checked for cheating
// by the online submission system. These algorithms are very good and will check against
// each of your classmate's submissions (in this section and other sections), projects that
// have been submitted in the past by previous students at this university and other
// universities, as well as content and code found on the internet. In short, if you cheat,
// EXPECT TO BE CAUGHT.
//
// Be aware that being caught for cheating can result in a 0% on the project for you AND the
// person that gave their code (it is your responsibility to not share your code, too). By the
// course breakdown, this will result in an automatic loss in 15% of your entire course grade.
//
// The instructor is available for help and there is NO REASON to take the risk in cheating.
